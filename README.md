## Expo - React Native application

Get started:

`npm i`  
`npm i -g expo-cli`  
`expo start`

## Running on Simulator/Emulator

*Download and install Android Studio*

`brew install android-studio`  
`brew install android-platform-tools`

Create a '_non-Google Play_' Android Virtual Devices (*AVD*) from the configure dropdown of the Android Studio Welcome screen called _AVD Manager_.  
Run the newly created AVD from the Manager window.  
(*MUST BE RUNNING IN ORDER FOR EXPO TO COMMUNICATE WITH IT*)

*Download and install Xcode*

Create an iOS simulator in Xcode (_usually not necessary as Xcode will auto-create iPhone Xs and Xr sims_).


**From the expo terminal type `a` to trigger running the app on the `A`ndroid emulator or type `i` to run the app on the `i`OS simulator.**
